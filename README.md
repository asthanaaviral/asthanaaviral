## 🧩 Who am I (without the boring stuff)?

I’m the kind of developer who:
- opens **DevTools** before opening Google  
- enjoys debugging *after* fixing the bug  
- believes curiosity > certificates  
- thinks side projects say more than resumes  

I don’t just write code —  
I **experiment, explore, and iterate**.

But tools change.  
**Problem-solving doesn’t.**

• Writing cleaner logic than yesterday
• Understanding how systems actually work
• Building projects that feel "alive"
• Learning by breaking and rebuilding
